## The Problem
Studies and organizations like the American Heart Association (AHA) and American Medical Association (AMA) have highlighted this issue. For instance, one study found that only 3% of patients measured their BP without error. Another states that inaccurate BP measurements can lead to inappropriate management decisions in 20% to 45% of cases. 

## How BP measurement goes wrong:
1. Patient-related
    * Acute meal ingestion
    * Caffeine
    * Nicotine
    * Full bladder
    * Engaged in physical activity before
    * Not resting comfortably in a quiet env
2. Procedure-related
    * Patient arm lower than heart
    * Patients legs are crossed
    * Talking 
3. Equipment-related
    * Cuff is too small/large
    * Outdated equipment
4. Physician- or health professional-related
    * Failure to include a 5 minute reset period
    * Failure to make multiple measurements
    * Physician readings > nurse readings


## Our Vision
We are developing an intelligent, AI-driven assistant to help people accurately take their blood pressure at home. Blood pressure measurements are highly sensitive to user errors such as incorrect cuff placement, poor posture, or arm positioning. Our solution uses real-time computer vision and AI to guide users step-by-step, ensuring reliable and consistent readings.
